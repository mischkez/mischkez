Hello world!

I started my journey into coding during my college years, where I was intrigued by Java. However, after graduation, I found myself in the freelance world where PHP was more in demand. I embraced the change and spent a lot of time learning and working with it.

As I navigated through my freelance projects, I broadened my skills to include MySQL, JavaScript, Vue.js, HTML, CSS, and Ruby. Yet, it was a personal side project, a book site scraping application in Python, that truly sparked my passion for programming. The satisfaction of solving problems and creating something from an idea was fascinating.

From then on, programming became more than just a job. It's a journey of continual learning and adaptation. I'm currently interested in exploring Flutter and Dart, as well as Rust in the near future.
